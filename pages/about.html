          If you've reached a point in life where you find yourself asking, “Who
          am I, really?” some self-discovery can help you get to know yourself a
          little better.

              <h3>Start by visualizing your ideal self</h3>
              <p>
                Many people end up defining themselves by their relationships
                with others or the things they've always done, never considering
                the possibility of anything different.
              </p>
              <p>
                Wthout a clear idea of the things that matter to you or the
                person you hope to become, though, you'll continue living for
                other people instead of yourself.

              <h3>Explore your passions</h3>
              <p>
                Living out your passion might involve identifying the job you
                really want and researching the steps necessary for a career
                change. Or, maybe it's exploring ways to volunteer with your
                skills as a street medic.
              </p>
              <p>
                Keep in mind that passions don't always have to be complex or
                relate to professional interests. Think about what you spend
                your free time doing on a day-to-day basis. What excites you and
                brings joy to your life?

              <h3>Try new things</h3>
              <p>
                One good way to begin figuring this out? Do something new and
                totally different. You won't know what you enjoy until you give
                it a shot, right?

                Maybe you've always had an interest in artistic pursuits but
                never attempted anything after a college ceramics class. Check
                your local library or other community centers for free or
                low-cost adult learning classes.

              <h3>Evaluate your skills</h3>
              <p>
                Most people have a particular knack for something or other —
                crafting, home improvement, cooking, or any number of other
                skills. As part of the self-discovery process, you might
                consider taking some time to consider your unique abilities and
                how you might use them.
